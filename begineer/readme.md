### ChatGPT ChatBot with Streamlit and OpenAI
This project is a simple chatbot interface built using Streamlit and the OpenAI API. It leverages the gpt-3.5-turbo model from OpenAI to generate conversational responses. The chatbot takes user input through a text box, sends it to OpenAI's API, and displays the AI's response in a chat-style format.

### Features
* User-friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for quick and easy interaction.
* Chat-style Conversations: Each user input and OpenAI response are displayed in a message-based format.
* Integration with OpenAI's Latest API: Uses the ChatCompletion method to generate responses from the gpt-3.5-turbo model.


### How to Run
